Hello, welcome to my word counter. To run the jar open cmd to the location of the project and type java -jar wordCount-1.0.0.jar

Ive included what i define a word in this program in the comments but ill also copy it here
	/**
	 *  I have decided that any group of characters split by whitespace is a word if it contains a letter of the alphabet
	 *  or a number. There is also one special character that can be considered a word on its own which is the '&'
	 *  This does unfortunately mean that languages that do not use A-Z are not going to work with this program. 
	 *  But given the specification I deemed that not necessary and they could be added later if that was deemed important.
	 *  
	 *  For word length I'm also extracting out certain punctuation ("!?<>:;,.) and line endings.
